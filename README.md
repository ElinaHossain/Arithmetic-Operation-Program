## What does it do?
This program prompts the user to enter their name, an integer, and a floating-point number. It then performs calculations based on the entered values and displays the result along with a personalized message. The program also includes some error handling to check if the inputs are valid. If any of the inputs are invalid, it displays an error message and exits the program. Additionally, if the entered name is "bob" (case-insensitive), it prints a special message!


## What I learned
- Use the Scanner class to read user input from the console.
- Validate user input using conditional statements (if and else if).
- Perform calculations based on user input.
- Handle different data types such as String, int, and double.
- Display output using the System.out.println() method.
- Use the equals() and equalsIgnoreCase() methods to compare strings.
- Implement basic error handling by checking for valid input.
- Exit a program using the return statement.

## Notes
If I had to do it again I would replace the if-else if statements for selecting the first operator with a switch statement. This would make the code more readable and concise. This was my first Java project from the course COMP 111B.
